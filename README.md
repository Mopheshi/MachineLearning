# Machine Learning

Machine Learning Specializations offered by DeepLearning.AI and Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute through Coursera.

This repository also houses my ML practice projects.

Practice datasets are gotten from: [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/standard-machine-learning-datasets/#:~:text=In%20this%20post,%20you#:~:text=In%20this%20post,%20you) and [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets?skip=0&take=10&sort=desc&orderBy=NumHits&search=)
